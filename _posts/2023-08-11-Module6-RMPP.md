## Summary Of The Module
- This module is about research methods and the professional practices that need to be incorporated when a group or an individual decides on starting a project/ research.
- We learned the definition of research, observed what type of researches are available, making a choice of the research type based on the scenario of the project, and so on.
- During the course of this module, we performed many activities that involved excel to understand statistical terms like minimum value, maximum value, range, inter-quartile ranges, etc.
- There also were interesting and engaging discussions held during the module which helped peers understand different perspectives and areas in which research methods can be extensively used. There were live seminars conducted by our professor that helped us further in this module.
- Amidst the course, we were also asked to carry out a few formative and summative activities, that would be later shown in this post.

## Key Takeaways From The Module
The following were the key takeaways from this module:
- Explore and understand the definition of research.
- Look at some of the professional practices that are necessary while doing a research project.
- Delve into statistical concepts that help understand the data that is used in the research more extensively. 
- Perform statistical analysis activites on datasets given in the module.
- Understand how to individually carry out a research task.

## Description of Activities Performed During The Module
Here's a brief description of what was done during the module:
- During Unit 1, there was an introductory seminar held, where in, after introductiosn, we jumped straight to what all was going to be covered in the module. There was an activity present in the module, ([Unit1-Reflective-Activity.docx]([https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Intelligent-Agents](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Research%20Methods%20and%20Professionsl%20Practices))), that asked us how would we look at the given situation if we were incharge of it.
- Units 2 thorugh 4 had not much to do but to go through the given materials in the module, look at the guide given to the students about how and what to involve in the literature review, that was supposed to be given in at the end of module. We even followed lecturecasts present in the module to gain more understanding on the subject matter.
- Unit 5 had another reflective activity ([Unit5-Reflective-Activity.docx]([https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Intelligent-Agents](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Research%20Methods%20and%20Professionsl%20Practices))), which asked about social, professional, ethical implications of a research project in two areas/industries if said research is misused.
- Units 6 and 7 focused on what methods can be used to gather data, like, surveys, polls, etc. and what are the professional practices involved in doing them.
- Units 8 and 9 had delved into statistical analysis techniques that can be used to understand the gathered data better. Here, we were given a few exercisses to be completed using the statistical analysis techniques ([excel sheets, worksheets with interpretations are here]([https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Intelligent-Agents](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Research%20Methods%20and%20Professionsl%20Practices))).
- The tail end of the module focused on how to develop an e-portfolio for professional purposes.

I had faced many challenges during this module, due to which, I was not able to accomplish my tasks in a timely manner. Nevertheless, as per instructions given to me by the school, I had tried my best to work through the module and make the required submissions.
