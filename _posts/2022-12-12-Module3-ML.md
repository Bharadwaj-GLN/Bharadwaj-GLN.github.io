## Summary of The Module
In this module, we:
- learned about the history of ML and how it can help solve complex tasks
- came across powerful Machine learning algorithms
- Discovered various data analysis techniques
- performed the data analysis techniques on different kinds of data

## Description of The Activities Performed
During the initial stages of the module, we discoverd what ML is, what was its past, present, and future, and how will it help counter complex problems that deal with complex and big data. There are certain activities that were performed in the module, the details of which are given below:
- The first activity involved linear, multiple linear, and polynomial regression techniques. You can access the artefacts [here](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Machine-Learning/e-portfolio-activity1)
