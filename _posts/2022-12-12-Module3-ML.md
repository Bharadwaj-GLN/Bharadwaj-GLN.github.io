## Summary of The Module
In this module, we:
- learned about the history of ML and how it can help solve complex tasks
- came across powerful Machine learning algorithms
- Discovered various data analysis techniques
- performed the data analysis techniques on different kinds of data

## Description of The Activities Performed
During the initial stages of the module, we discoverd what ML is, what was its past, present, and future, and how will it help counter complex problems that deal with complex and big data. There are certain activities that were performed in the module, the details of which will be presented later below. During the middle stages of the module, students were instructed to perform regression analysis, clustering analysis, and many more techniques on the NYC AirBnB data ([access here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)). The artefacts for the assignment, i.e., the code, data, presentation, etc. can be found [here](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Machine-Learning/Assignment1)

In parallel, students were also instructed to complete a few activities, which helped strengthen the knowledge on ML. The first activity involved linear, multiple linear, and polynomial regression techniques. You can access the artefacts for the activities [here.](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Machine-Learning/e-portfolio-activity1)

Furthermore, we learned more about complex ML algorithms like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs), which were helpful for us to accomplish the final assignment of the module. The last assignment dealt with CIFAR10 ([access dataset here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10)), a dataset containing 60,000 images of 10 different categoeires. Students had to classify each image into its respective category by building the neural network ML algorithms and test the same too for evaluation. A few more concepts like backpropagation, hyper-parameter tuning, and choosing the best suited model were also conducted as part of data activites, by the students. The artefacts for the second assignment can be found [here.](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Machine-Learning/Assignment2)

Here are some other data activites performed by the students, as per the module instructions:
- The second data activity dealt with developing a single layered perceptron and multi layered perceptron so as to thoroughly understand, how to build a neural network and what are the required layers. You can access the artefacts [here.](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Machine-Learning/e-portfolio-activity2)
- The third activity was about tuning the hyperparameters of the neural network, in order to obtain optimal results for the model. Artefacts are present [here](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Machine-Learning/e-portfolio-activity3) for this activity.
- Later, we conducted few more activites on how to select the best model for our data and also built a convolutional newral network using the prescribed data. The required files are accessible [here,](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Machine-Learning/e-portfolio-activity4) for CNNs, and [here,](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Machine-Learning/e-portfolio-activity5) for selecting the best model.


## Key Takeaways From the Module
We have observed many key concepts in this module, out of which, the most important ones are listed below. The reflection document for this module is present [here](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Machine-Learning). The name of the file is Reflection-ML_PCOM7E.docx. 
- History of ML and the ethical issues caused by it
- Regression and classification ML models along with useful data analysis techniques
- Complex ML models like Neural networks, that are used to accomplish time consuming tasks.
- Tuning the neural networks to get the optimal result and also select the best possible one, as per the business requirement.

Overall, this module was packed with tons of ML algorithms, which, will definitely prove to be useful in the future. The ethical issues, that come with the concept of ML will also be remembered whenever, a problem, that involves data is presented.
