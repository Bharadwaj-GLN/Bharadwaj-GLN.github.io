## Summary Of The Module
- This module is about intelligent agents, that, in simple terms, are programs/algorithms, built into a machine to make it capable of carrying a task using logic, decision making skills and many other parameters.
- We learned how are they built, what tools and software are required in order to build one, what kind of tasks they can do and many other things.
- During the course of this module, we, as 2-3 member groups put together our versions of intelligent agents, as a part of the project that we had to develop in this course.
- We also participated in interesting and engaging discussions and understood different perspectives and areas in which intelligent agents can be extensively used. There were live seminars conducted by our professor that helped us further in this module.
- Amidst the course, we were also asked to carry out a few formative and summative activities, that would be later shown in this post.

## Key Takeaways From The Module
The following were the key takeaways from this module:
- Explore and learn concepts like NLP, ANN, CNN, etc., and other agent based communication languages like KQML, and KIF.
- Develop the intelligent agents using python and its libraries
- Deploy the agents onto a server and monitor the same.
- Evaluate the performance of the agent and analyse more efficient ways to make the agent work in a given environment.
- Understand team dynamics while doing the course.

## Description of Activities Performed During The Module
Here's a brief description of what was done during the module:
- During Units 1-3, we made posts in the discussion forum of our learning platform ([access my posts and responses' doc here](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Intelligent-Agents)). During this time, I had explored a few articles, journals, etc. on intelligent agents and how were they being utilized efficiently in various domains. This is where I had picked up on the use of intelligent agents in the real estate sector, for which, one of my fellow students gave an insightful response.
- After units 4 & 5, we were asked to create an agent communication dialog in which 2 parties communicate about the given question (find out the count of 50 Inch TVs and number of HDMI Cables). The response is given below ([access file here](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Intelligent-Agents)). I had gone through our prof's lecturecasts and also did some reading on KQML language and how it can be used for communicating amongst different agents. This was a fairly new concept to me as I had not encountered anywhere in the past. It was really easy to understand and hence, I was able to whip up the summative e-portfolio question about 2 agents exchanging information about the stock of 50 inch TVs and also stock quantity of HDMI cables. I had split the execution into 2 separate parts and had generated the response for clarity purposes.

- In Unit 6, the students were asked to develop a roadmap to building an intelligent agent. In this report, we discussed how will we build out agent (BOT in our case), what are all the dependencies that are required in building this bot and what is the bot capable of doing. [The file named Group3 Intelligent Agent Assignment 1](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Intelligent-Agents) describes our work for the first stint of the module. This was not particularly challenging because it did not involve much of the tools and software that our team would later use in the second half of the module. Even then, it took us a fair number of iterations to come up with a detailed roadmap of what had our team planned for the second stint of the module. 
- In the second half of the module, i.e., from unit 7, we came across algorithms like NLP, Word2Vec, etc. that are extensively used on a daily basis by the intelligent agents. I had come across NLP and the concepts around it once in the machine learning module, which was one of my previous modules in this study program. Navigating through this part of the course was fairly easy a sI was able to recall concepts quickly.
- We also created condition based parse trees, that sees NLP in action, as a part of our summative e-portfolio activity in Unit 8. Following are the responses generated from the code. I was able to understand how powerful NLP is after executing the code and generating the output.

- In unit 9, we explored deep learning algorithms like ANNs, CNNs, and RNNs, that help in building complex yet very intelligent agents that carry out complex tasks. Again, I had come across various neural network concepts in the past, due to which, listening to the lecturecasts, seminars and study materials cemented the concepts nicely. 
- We also had to research on organizations that effectively use these deep learning algorithms in order to get things done. [Deep-Learning-EPortfolio](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Intelligent-Agents) file shows how a company uses deep learning in the finance industry for accomplishing goals. It mainly utilizes 2 algorithms, deep neural nets and NLP in order to analyse textual data, news articles and other information to gather relevant insights and patterns from the data. NLP was used to determine sentiment, language translation, etc. by the company from a wide range of resources. However, there were ethical and socio economic implications with utilizing AI powered agents like bias in data, fear of job displacement, etc. By constantly bringing the ethical concerns of using AI in providing solutions, it has now become an integral part of my thought process, which, for future challenges, can prove to be useful. 
- As we reached the end of our module, we developed a bot that was capable of moving files on a server from a source folder to a destination folder. [This PPT file](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Intelligent-Agents) and a Zip folder contained at the same location as the presentation are proof of the work that was done as a part of the second and final stint of the module. Again, we sat through calls, meetings, discussing on how could we build the bot efficiently. The presentation is a clear proof of our work in the second half of the module.

During the course of the module, there were many challenges, at least for me, like not having the required Python version, lack of different modules in python, lack of compute power for faster code compilation and a few unforeseen circumstances due to which I was unable to actively participate in the discussions that happened in the second half of the module. Nevertheless, I was in touch with the teammates during the course of this module and had decent number of contributions made in order to get the job done. Despite the challenges, this module has most definitely helped me learn new concepts, understand new team dynamics, which, I intend to carry forward and apply as well in any future challenges. Finally, I'd like to thank my Professor, Oliver Buckley, for educating us with the concept of intelligent agents.
