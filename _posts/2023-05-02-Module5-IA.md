## Summary Of The Module
- This module is about intelligent agents, that, in simple terms, are programs/algorithms, built into a machine to make it capable of carrying a task using logic, decision making skills and many other parameters.
- We learned how are they built, what tools and softwares are required in order to build one, what kind of tasks they can do and many other things.
- During the course of this module, we, as 2-3 member groups put together our versions of intelligent agents, as a part of the project that we had to develop in this course.
- We also participated in interesting and engaging discussions and understood different perspectives and areas in which intelligent agents can be extensively used. There were live seminars conducted by our professor that helped us further in this module.
- Amidst the course, we were also asked to carry out a few formative and summative activities, that would be later shown in this post.

## Key Takeaways From The Module
The following were the key takeaways from this module:
- Explore and learn concepts like NLP, ANN, CNN, etc., and other agent based communication languages like KQML, and KIF.
- Develop the intelligent agents using python and its libraries
- Deploy the agents onto a server and monitor the same.
- Evaluate the performance of the agent and analyse more efficient ways to make the agent work in a given environment.
- Understand team dynamics while doing the course.

## Description of Activities Performed During The Module
Here's a brief description of what was done during the module:
- During Units 1-3, we made posts in the discussion forum of our learning platform ([access my posts and responses' doc here](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Intelligent-Agents))
- After units 4 & 5, we were asked to create an agent communication dialog in which 2 parties communicate about the given question (find out the count of 50 Inch TVs and number of HDMI Cables). The response is given below ([access file here](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Intelligent-Agents)).

- In Unit 6, the students were asked to develop a roadmap to building an intelligent agent. In this report, we discussed how will we build out agent (BOT in our case), what are all the dependencies that are required in building this bot and what is the bot capable of doing. [The file named Group3 Intelligent Agent Assignment 1](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Intelligent-Agents) describes our work for the first stint of the module. This was not particularly challenging because it did not involve much of the tools and softwares that our team would later use in the second half of the module. 
- In the second half of the module, i.e., from unit 7, we came across algorithms like NLP, Word2Vec, etc. that are extensively used on a daily basis by the intelligent agents.
- We also created condition based parse trees, that sees NLP in action, as a part of our summative e-portfolio activity in  Unit 8. Following are the responses generated from the code.

- In unit 9, we explored deep learning algorithms like ANNs, CNNs, and RNNs, that help in building complex yet very intelligent agents that carry out complex tasks.
- We also had to research on organizations that effectively use these deep learning algorithms in order to get thinhs done. [Deep-Learning-EPortfolio](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Intelligent-Agents) file shows how a company uses deep learning in the finance industry for accomplishing goals.
- As we reached the end of our module, we developed a bot that was capable of moving files on a server from a source folder to a destination folder. [This PPT file](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-GLN/Uni-Essex-Module-Files/tree/main/Intelligent-Agents) and a Zip folder contained at the same location as the presentation are proof of the work that was done as a part of the second and final stint of the module.

During the course of the module, there were many challenges, atleast for me, like not having the required Python version, lack of different modules in python, lack of compute power for faster code compilation and a few unforseen circumstances due to which I was unable to actively participate in the discussions that happened in the second half of the module. Nevertheless, I was in touch with the teammates during the course of this module and had decent amount of contributions made in order to get the job done. Despite the challenges, this module has most definitely helped me learn new concepts, understand new team dynamics, which, I intend to carry forward and apply as well in any future challenges. Finally, I'd like to thank my Professor, Oliver Buckley, for educating us with the concept of intelligent agents.
