## Summary of the module
We had explored the following aspects in the KRR module:
- The concepts associated with KRR (Knowledge Bases, tools, etc.)
- Learned about Ontologies, modelling techniques, software associated with developing the ontologies. 
- Developed and analysed ontologies as part of project work
- Also developed different perspectives towards solving problems using KRR

## Description of The Module
At the start of the KRR module, we familiarized ourselves with the definitions of terms, i.e., what is a knowledge base, how to interpret data WRT KRR terms as well as in common knowledge. In parallel, we were also instucted to discuss using the student forum, which unfortunately, ran dry as the module progressed. After take off, we then explored the concepts of set theory, First Order Logic(FOL) and learned how are set theory and truth tables related and how can they be used to logically solve problems. I must admit that it was due to my negligence that I was not able to complete the formative activities present in the module. However, I was able to submit the first assignment on time.

In the second half of the module, I occupied myself with developing a prototype
